## Introduction

 

In this repository, you will find the various components of my thesis work. The original code was written for Matlab, this had been cleaned up and generalized neatly in two python classes.

 

## Files

 

The files are as follows:

 

* readme.md: this file

* LICENSE: license file

* execute.py: a toy example of the GPCA usage (taken from [this](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-decomposition-plot-pca-iris-py))

* GPCA.py: generalized principal component analisis code

* KGPCA: generalized kernel principal component analisis code

 

## Usage

 

The classes try to follow the [sklearn.decomposition.PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) and [sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA.html) respectively, so use them as such.

 

## Published Article

 

The published article related to this thesis work can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9054154).
The whole algorithm is explained much better and clear results are given.

If you need anymore details, this is my [PoliTo thesis](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/13126/) and this is my [UIC thesis](https://indigo.uic.edu/articles/thesis/A_Generalization_of_Principal_Component_Analysis/13475391?file=25863297).
