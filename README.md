## Introduction

 

In this repository, you will find the various components of my thesis work. The original code was written for Matlab, this had been cleaned up and generalized neatly in a python class.

 

## Files

 

The files are as follows:

 

* readme.md: this file

* LICENSE: license file

* execute.py: a toy example of the GPCA usage (taken from [this](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-decomposition-plot-pca-iris-py))

* GPCA.py: generalized principal component analisis code

* KGPCA: generalized kernel principal component analisis code (todo)

 

## Usage

 

The classes try to follow the sklearn.decomposition._BasePCA, so use them as such.

 

## Published Article

 

The published article related to this thesis work can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9054154).
The whole algorithm is explained much better and clear results are given.
